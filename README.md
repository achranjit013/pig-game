# Pig Game

Pig Game is a simple and fun two-player dice game that challenges your luck and decision-making skills. The game revolves around rolling a dice to accumulate points while avoiding the dreaded "1" that resets your turn. The first player to reach a score of 100 wins the game.

## How to Play

1. By default, Player 1 starts the game. Players can take turns to roll the dice.

2. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. The value will be added to your current score.

3. You can continue rolling as many times as you want, but be careful not to roll a "1." Rolling a "1" will reset your current score, and it will be the next player's turn.

4. To secure your points, click the "Hold" button. Your current score will be added to your total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

5. The game continues until one player reaches a score of 100 or more. The winning player's screen turns dark, and the game buttons are disabled.

6. To start a new game, simply click the "New Game" button.
